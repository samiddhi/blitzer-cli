* Changelog

All notable changes to the Blitzer CLI project will be documented in this file.

** [0.0.5] - 2025-11-19

*** Added

- *Enhanced configuration system*
  - Added configurable defaults for all boolean flags: =default_lemmatize=, =default_freq=, =default_context=, =default_prompt=, =default_src=
  - Added default language prompts for =base= and =en= languages
  - Implemented automatic config file creation with comprehensive defaults when none exists
  - Added dual flag system (--flag/--no-flag) allowing users to override configuration defaults
  - Added support for multi-line prompts in config using TOML multi-line string syntax

*** Changed

- *Refactored CLI flag system*
  - Updated all boolean flags to use --flag/--no-flag pattern for proper default override behavior
  - Removed the unused =default_language= configuration option from config file
  - Made language code required again since default was not properly used in workflow
  - Enhanced config loading to create default config when file doesn't exist
  - Updated default prompts to focus on Anki card generation: "Convert the following wordlist into tab separated anki cards."

*** Fixed

- Fixed CLI flag precedence system to properly allow config defaults to be overridden
- Corrected configuration file example to only include actually configurable options
- Removed obsolete code that was attempting to handle default language from config when language is required

** [0.0.4] - 2025-11-18

*** Added

- *Complete plugin architecture migration*
  - All language processors are now downloadable as separate plugins
  - Core package no longer includes any built-in language support
  - Language packs can be installed/uninstalled dynamically with =blitzer languages install/uninstall=

- *Simplified language plugin structure*
  - New =register()= function approach for language plugins
  - Cleaner architecture with dedicated configuration functions
  - Examples updated to reflect new minimal plugin structure

*** Changed

- *Removed all built-in language processors*
  - Pali, Slovenian, and other language processors are no longer included in core package
  - All language functionality now provided through downloadable plugins
  - Updated language discovery to work exclusively with plugin architecture

- Updated plugin system to use =register()= functions instead of processor classes
- Simplified plugin interface with configurable normalizers, tokenizers, and lemmatizers
- Enhanced plugin discovery and error handling
- Language listing now only shows 'base' instead of both 'base' and 'generic' (both still function equivalently)

*** Removed

- All built-in language processors (Pali, Slovenian, etc.)
- Legacy processor class architecture
- Built-in language data files

** [0.0.3] - 2025-11-17

*** Added

- *Implemented plugin architecture with entry points*
  - Added entry point system for downloadable language packs via =blitzer.languages= group
  - Created dynamic discovery and loading system for external processors
  - Added backward compatibility for different Python versions (3.8-3.12)

- *Added language management commands*
  - =blitzer languages list= to show all available languages (built-in and plugins)
  - =blitzer languages install <lang-code>= to install language packs via pip
  - =blitzer languages uninstall <lang-code>= to remove language packs

- *Created comprehensive test language pack (tst)*
  - Complete example plugin with SQLite database and processor implementation
  - Proper package structure with entry point definition
  - Database file bundled with the language pack

- *Implemented data file management*
  - Added =data_manager.py= for handling language-specific data files
  - Created utilities for downloading and caching language databases
  - Standardized data directory structure at =~/.config/blitzer/language_data/<lang>=

*** Changed

- Updated =get_available_languages()= to discover both built-in and plugin languages
- Improved error handling for plugin loading with better exception management
- Enhanced processor loading to work with both built-in modules and external plugins
- Updated =pyproject.toml= to include plugin entry points for built-in languages

*** Removed

- =blitzer list= superseded by =blitzer languages list=

*** Fixed

- Fixed Python version compatibility issues with =importlib.metadata.entry_points()= API
- Resolved issue where external plugins weren't being discovered due to API misuse
- Corrected exception handling that was silently swallowing plugin discovery errors

** [0.0.2] - 2025-11-16

*** Changed

- *Refactored from mode-based to flag-based CLI interface*
  - Replaced positional arguments for processing modes with boolean flags
  - Changed command structure from =blitzer [text] [language] [mode]= to =blitzer blitz -t [text] -l [language] [flags]=
  - Introduced subcommands: =blitz= for processing and =list= for showing supported languages

- *Made language support more dynamic and extensible*
  - Added requirement for each language module to implement a =get_processor()= factory function
  - Implemented dynamic loading of language processors using =importlib=
  - Removed need to modify core files when adding new languages
  - Made language registration fully automatic through directory scanning

*** Added

- Boolean flags for processing options:
  - =-L= / =--lemmatize=: Treats different declensions/forms of the same word as one word
  - =-f= / =--freq=: Include frequency counts in the output
  - =-c= / =--context=: Include sample context for each word in output
  - =-p= / =--prompt=: Include custom prompt for LLM at the top of output
  - =-s= / =--src=: Include the full source text at the top of output

- New =list= subcommand to show supported languages

- Added =generic= language processor for basic space-separated language processing

- Fixed syntax error in Pali language processor's normalize method

*** Changed

- Made language flag required (was previously optional with defaults)
- Updated language listing to exclude abstract base class
- Updated CLI help text to reflect new required language flag

*** Fixed

- Fixed bug where Pali processor had a floating =.replace()= call not attached to an object
- Fixed config loading code to use correct TOML import in config.py
- Corrected the processor loading mechanism to work with the new dynamic system

** [0.0.1] - Initial Release

*** Added

- Basic CLI tool with mode-based processing
- Support for Pali and Slovenian languages
- Configuration management using XDG specifications
- Basic text processing with tokenization and lemmatization
